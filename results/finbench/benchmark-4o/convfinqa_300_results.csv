period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements . with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .

q0: what is the net change in the balance of other intangible assets net from 2003 to 2004? {answer0}
Question: what percentage change does this represent?
Answer:",-0.03378,"the net change in the balance of other intangible assets net from 2003 to 2004 is $985,303 - $1,019,749 = -$34,446. 

to find the percentage change, use the formula:

\[
\text{percentage change} = \left( \frac{\text{net change}}{\text{initial value}} \right) \times 100
\]

substituting the values:

\[
\text{percentage change} = \left( \frac{-34,446}{1,019,749} \right) \times 100 \approx -3.38
\]

so, the percentage change is approximately -3.38."

commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt

on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair

management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders

the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative . 2030 averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments . an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average . for example , the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range . 2030 the ranges , averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative . for example , the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative . accordingly , the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in , or possible ranges of , fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives . 2030 interest rates , currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models , credit derivatives are valued using option pricing , correlation and discounted cash flow models , and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models . 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques . for example , option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value . therefore , the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques . 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation . 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas . 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products . range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments : 2030 correlation . ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type ( e.g. , equity index and equity single stock names ) and across product types ( e.g. , correlation of an interest rate and a currency ) , as well as across regions . generally , cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type . 2030 volatility . ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets , maturities and strike prices . for example , volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks . 2030 credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates . the ranges for credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers ( index and single names ) , regions , sectors , maturities and credit qualities ( high-yield and investment-grade ) . the broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs . 130

Context: the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee . the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions , estimates , accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements : 2022 revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans -
